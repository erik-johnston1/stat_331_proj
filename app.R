In simpler terms, it implies that asset prices already incorporate all known information and that it's impossible to consistently beat the market by outsmarting it.<br><br>
  
  There are three forms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis:<br><br>
  
  &emsp;1. Weak Form: This form suggests that all past market prices and data are already reflected in current prices. Therefore, technical analysis (examining past price movements) cannot be used to predict future price movements.<br><br>
  
    &emsp;2. Semi-Strong Form: This form suggests that all publicly available information is already reflected in asset prices. Therefore, neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis (examining financial statements and economic indicators) can consistently beat the market.<br><br>
  
    &emsp;3. Strong Form: This form suggests that all information, both public and private, is already reflected in asset prices. This implies that even insider information cannot give an investor an edge in the market.<br><br>
  
  The relevance of the Efficient Market Hypothesis to someone getting started in investing is significant. Here's how:<br><br>
  
    &emsp;1. Investment Strategies: EMH suggests that it's difficult to consistently beat the market through stock picking or market timing. Therefore, it encourages investors to adopt passive investment strategies, such as investing in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which aim to match the performance of the overall market rather than trying to beat it.<br><br>
  
    &emsp;2. Risk Management: EMH underscores the importance of diversification as a risk management strategy. Since it's difficult to predict which individual stocks will outperform the market, spreading investments across a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk.<br><br>
  
    &emsp;3. Long-Term Perspective: EMH suggests that short-term fluctuations in asset prices are largely unpredictable. Therefore, investors should focus on long-term investing goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.<br><br>
  
    &emsp;4. Informational Advantage: EMH implies that it's challenging to gain an informational advantage in the market. Instead of trying to outsmart other investors, beginners are encouraged to focus on learning the fundamentals of investing, such as understanding the principles of asset allocation, risk management, and the importance of staying disciplined in their investment approach.<br><br>
  
  In summary, while the Efficient Market Hypothesis may seem discouraging to those hoping to beat the market consistently, it provides valuable insights for beginners by emphasizing the importance of adopting a disciplined, long-term investment approach based on diversification and passive investing strategies."
